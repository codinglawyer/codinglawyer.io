Hi everyone,

my name is David Kopal and I’m a web developer focusing on modern web technologies such as React, and functional programming in JavaScript. Programming is not only my job but my passion as well because I just love that feeling of creativity.

Originally, I graduated from a law school and worked as a lawyer for a couple of years. Dissatisfied with this job, *[I decided to broaden my horizons and programming hooked me straight away.](https://www.codinglawyer.io/posts/i-stopped-being-a-lawyer)*

When I began to code, I started *[a blog about my journey from a lawyer to a developer.](https://codinglawyer.blogspot.com/)* After seven months, when I got a programming job, I decided that it's time to get more experience before coming back to the blogging.

**It's been exactly one year since I got the job. I feel that now it's the right time to start blogging again.**

So, I created this new blog. The idea is to write primarily about programming topics that interest or challenge me and which could be beneficial for you as well.

Stay Tuned!
