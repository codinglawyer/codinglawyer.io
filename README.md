# Source code for my website [codinglawyer.io](https://www.codinglawyer.io/)

## What?

It’s a server-side rendered application built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). For the content management, it uses [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/). So, the entire app lives inside this repository, with all the blog posts and their drafts.
For the time being, most of the blog posts are fetched from my previous site built with Wordpress - [codinglawyer.net](https://codinglawyer.net/). This is done using the Gatsby-wordpress plugin which communicates with the Wordpress JSON API via GraphQL.

Nevertheless, this application is still **a work in progress...**

## Why?

I read a lot about Gatsby and I wanted to see for myself if the development is really that smooth. I found out it absolutely is. Building the first version of this site took me just a couple of days (with all the data fetching from my Wordpress site). I was amazed at how far you can get with just React knowledge without studying Gatsby’s docs in advance (that was bad, bad, bad. Always read the docs first, everyone!)
